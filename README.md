# Desolate Depths: A Dungeon-Crawling Adventure

Class *Main* contains the main method and acts as the entry point from which to run the game.

At this time, there are no rooms implemented, so upon initialization you should see the main introduction, a test message showing that a player has been instantiated, and the prompt.

## Current Commands
At this time, the following command are functional:

- *'exit'*  - quits the game 
- *'save'* saves your character without exiting 
- *'print log'* prints the contents of the current character's log file to the screen.
