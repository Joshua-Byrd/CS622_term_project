## Desolate Depths: A Dungeon-Crawling Adventure

Class *Main* contains the main method and acts as the entry point from which to run the game.

At this time, there are no rooms implemented, so upon initialization you should see the main introduction, a test message showing that a player has been instantiated, and the prompt.  Type *'exit'* to quit the game.
